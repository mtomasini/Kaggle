# Kaggle projects

In this Github I want to keep track of my kaggle projects. 

For now I limited myself to two problems:
- Titanic challenge: to get my feet wet, I did both the tutorial and an implementation of DNN to analyze the Titanic challenge.
- Killer shrimp challenge: this challenge is the reason I joined in the first place, since it was proposed by a group I am close with for work. After a first failed attempt using support vector machines, I studied one of the solutions that used XGBoost, and then performed my own version in which I did not do any feature engineering.
- Housing prices: I looked through the dataset and learned a couple of tricks about EDA (exploratory data analysis).
- Spaceship-Titanic: tried this for fun to train keras' tuners.

I am now starting with the House Prices dataset, to refresh my memory with data exploration and regression techniques.

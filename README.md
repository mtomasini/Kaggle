# Kaggle projects

In this Github I want to keep track of my kaggle projects. 

For now I limited myself to two problems:
- Titanic challenge: to get my feet wet, I did both the tutorial and an implementation of DNN to analyze the Titanic challenge.
- Killer shrimp challenge: this challenge is the reason I joined in the first place, since it was proposed by a group I am close with for work. I will definitely revisit this as I go along, as it pertains to the prediction of events from a big dataset with small number of events on record, and the dataset itself fascinates me.

I am now starting with the House Prices dataset, to refresh my memory with data exploration and regression techniques.
